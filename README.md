Java Sorting Algorithms:

This repository contains implementations of fundamental sorting algorithms in Java, each demonstrating a different approach to organizing and processing data efficiently. These algorithms are commonly used in computer science education, competitive programming, and real-world applications involving data manipulation.

Overview
The following sorting techniques are included in this project:

  1. Bubble Sort – Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

  2. Selection Sort – Selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.

  3. Insertion Sort – Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.

  4. Counting Sort – Non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that works best for small ranges of integers.

Each sorting algorithm is implemented with simple examples and can be activated by uncommenting the respective main method section in the code.
